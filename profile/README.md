## 🛠 Our Projects  
We’ve built **3 apps** so far, with more in the works. Here’s a spotlight on one of them:

### 🔒 Echo
**A Privacy-First Messaging App**  
Echo is our take on secure, end-to-end encrypted communication—think Signal or Telegram, but stripped down to essentials. No phone numbers, no emails—just pick a name and start chatting.  

- **Key Features**:  
  - End-to-end encryption for all messages.  
  - Messages encrypted even in our database—only you and your friends can read them.  
  - No personal data required to get started.  
  - Lightweight, fast, and simple.  

*More apps coming soon—stay tuned!*
